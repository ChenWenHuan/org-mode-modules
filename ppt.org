* Introduction
** Language -- a constant?
\pause
*** Sense change, context change, new words, etc.
*** "run", "gay", "photography"
\pause
** Study of Language as an evolutionary phenomenon
\pause
*** Requires large amounts of non-contemporary data
*** Google Books and Google Ngrams?

* Introduction -- contd.
** Quantify changes in word usage due to
\pause
*** Sense change
*** Frequency change
*** Change in co-occuring topics
*** ...
\pause
** Using Google Books
*** 3 epochs: 1800+/-25 yrs, 1900+/-25 yrs, 2000+/-25 yrs

* Related Work
** Previous Work at higher level
\pause
*** Culturomics -- changes in human nature
*** Language = Genetics?
*** Scientific topics over time
*** Changes in context reflecting events occuring at that time

** How words themselves change?

* WED formulation
\pause
** Classify period of time when a word was used
\pause
** Epoch = Period of 50 years
\pause
** Publication year of book $\sim$ Time when word is used

* Experimental Setting -- Target Words
** Driven by aim: Sense change or Context change?
\pause
*** Polysemous and Monosemous words
*** Words frequent in all epochs and in one epoch
\pause
** 50 words for each open class (nouns, adj, verbs, and adv)
*** 25 polysemous and 25 monosemous
*** 10-5-5-5 frequency-wise distribution
** 165 with enough examples

* Experimental Setting -- Data
** Top 100 snippets per target word per epoch
** Processing snippets
*** Tokenization
*** POS tagging
** POS Unambiguity
* Experimental Setting -- Example
1800: On reaching Mr. Crane’s house, \textbf{dinner}
was set before us ; but as is usual here in many
places on the Sabbath, it was both \textbf{dinner} and
tea combined into a single meal.\vspace{4mm}

1900: The average \textbf{dinner} of today consists
of relishes; of soup, either a consomme (clear
soup) or a thick soup.\vspace{4mm}

2000: Preparing \textbf{dinner} in a slow cooker is
easy and convenient because the meal you’re
making requires little to no attention while it
cooks.

* Algorithm and Evalution
** Local and Topical features (similar to Ng and Lee, 1996)
# *** Current word, its POS, 1st noun before and after target word, etc.
# *** Class-specific keywords, occuring at least 3 times in def. of class
\pause
** Naive Bayes Classifier (Ng and Lee, 2002)
\pause
** 10-fold Cross validation
** Baseline: Most frequent class
     
* Results and Discussion
** Absolute Improvement of 18.5%
\pause
*** "computer" (42%) and "install" (41%)
*** "again" (3%) and "captivate" (7%)
\pause
** 2 kinds of analysis:
*** Change in frequency
*** Change in sense
   
* Results and Discussion contd.
** Frequency change:
*** Words frequent in all epochs v/s only in one epoch
\pause
** Sense change:
*** Monosemous words
**** Only changes in context helps
*** Polysemous words
**** Context change and
**** Change in meaning

* Results and Discussion contd.

* Conclusion
** Differences in occurences of words in different epochs
** Usage frequency and Word sense both contribute to these differences
\pause
** Future Work
*** Feature selection
*** Representation to track sense changes
